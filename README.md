a repository of scripts for identifying writers in Wikidata

this repository contains scripts for identifying various kinds of writers in Wikidata. most of the scripts are for identifying French and Francophone writers but can be modified to find other writers of other nationalities or who write, speak, or sign other languages.

the easiest way to use these scripts is by cutting and pasting the text into the Wikidata Query Service (https://query.wikidata.org). For more information on querying Wikidata and the Query service see https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/Wikidata_Query_Help.
